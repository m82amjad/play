					<h3>Best Practices</h3>
					<p>These examples make most transaction fields available to
					edit when submitting the transaction. This is intended for this example only to
					simplify the process. In your integration, the only fields you should ever
					display to the customer are those requiring the customer to enter data. All
					other fields should be generated in your code (Process.php in this example) and not be available to the customer.</p>

					<p>In line with the above, you should never use HTML hidden
					fields to submit data to be used in the transaction request. Instead, you should
					specify and set these values within your application code (i.e. Process.php based on this example)</p>
